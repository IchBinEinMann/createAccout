## Project Goal

An application for creating accounts. It should contain functions responsible for:

### Data Retrieval

The application should retrieve user data such as:

1. First name
2. Last name
3. Position

### Password Generation

#### Select Password Generation Options

The user selects password generation options such as:

1. Capital letters
2. Numbers
3. Project symbols

#### Generate

The program generates a password based on the selected options and displays it.

### Display Account Information

After selecting the confirm option, the program displays:

1. First name
2. Last name
3. Position
4. Password

## Project Assumptions

1. The console application runs on Windows 10/11
2. The console application has a logical layout of displayed messages
3. The console application is optimized
4. The console application works as quickly as possible using as few computer resources as possible
5. The code of the console application contains clean code principles
6. The code of the console application is abstract (you don't need to know how it works to use it)
7. The functions are reusable (functionality from this project can be used in other projects)
